Ingredients:
- 80g pack instant noodles (look for an Asian brand with a flavour like sesame)
- 2 spring onions, finely chopped
- Â½ head pak choi
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp sesame seeds
- chilli sauce, to serve

Method
STEP 1
  Cook the noodles with the sachet of flavouring provided
(or use stock instead of the sachet, if you have it). Add the spring
onions and pak choi for the final min.

STEP 2
  Meanwhile, simmer the egg for 6 mins from boiling, run it under
cold water to stop it cooking, then peel it. Toast the sesame seeds
in a frying pan.

STEP 3
  Tip the noodles and greens into a deep bowl, halve the boiled egg
and place on top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, then drizzle with
the sauce or sesame oil provided with the noodles, and chilli sauce,
if using.
